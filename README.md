## Description
A static web site application allowing users to view potential candidates for hiring from GitHub, allows users to save potential candidates and render them on a table, with options to sort and remove results.
## Installation
N/A
## Usage
Navigate to deployed application [HERE](https://candidate-search-j3qk.onrender.com/). You will be presented with a card displaying a GitHub user's avatar, name, location, email, company, and bio (if available). Click the red minus button to skip the candidate and returns a new candidate. Click the green plus button to store that candidate in local storage to be rendered on the potential candidates page. Click the Potential Candidates link in the nav bar to see all saved Candidates in a table. You can click the red "reject" button to remove a potential candidate from the list. Using the dropdown menu just above the table will allow you to sort the table in various ways. A video demonstration of the application can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gQJmU0c-XXsK6LzVbCLFJTFdjxMQRjkZ/view?usp=sharing).
